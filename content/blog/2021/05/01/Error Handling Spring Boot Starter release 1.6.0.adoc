There is a new version 1.6.0 of the https://github.com/wimdeblauwe/error-handling-spring-boot-starter[Error Handling Spring Boot Starter]. A lot of new things have been added since I https://www.wimdeblauwe.com/blog/2021/02/18/error-handling-spring-boot-starter-release-1.2.0/[lasted blogged about version 1.2.0 of this library], so it is time for a round-up to show the new goodies.

<!--more-->

== New default error code generation strategy

Previous versions (before 1.5.0) used the full qualified name of the `Exception` class as the error code.

Suppose you had this exception:

[source,java]
----
package com.company.application.user;

public class UserNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    public UserNotFoundException() {
        super("User was not found");
    }
}
----

This would generated this error response:

[source,json]
----
{
  "code": "com.company.application.user.UserNotFoundException",
  "message": "User was not found"
}
----

Since 1.5.0, the default `code` uses the `ALL_CAPS` https://wimdeblauwe.github.io/error-handling-spring-boot-starter/#error-code-style[error code style] by default, resulting in this error response:

[source,json]
----
{
  "code": "USER_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "User was not found"
}
----

The reason that the FQN was used before was that you are sure there are no name clashes. However, I believe the `ALL_CAPS` is a better default, and Twitter seems to agree:

++++
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What should be the default style for error codes in the error-handling library? <a href="https://t.co/4KyVSzEXBp">https://t.co/4KyVSzEXBp</a></p>&mdash; Wim Deblauwe (@wimdeblauwe) <a href="https://twitter.com/wimdeblauwe/status/1376871926224814085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
++++

If name clashes would happen, then there are enough override mechanisms in the library to deal with it.

== HTTP response status in response body

By default, Spring Boot itself has the HTTP response status as a field in the JSON response body. Version 1.5.0 of the library now also added the possibility to enable this behaviour:

[source,properties]
----
error.handling.http-status-in-json-response=true
----

The resulting error response would be:

[source,java]
----
{
  "status": 404, //<.>
  "code": "USER_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Could not find user with id 123"
}
----
<.> HTTP status code as field in the JSON response

== More support for validation problems

2 new features have been added to support error response related to validation:

* The `javax.validation.ConstraintViolationException` is now also supported. This exception is used when you validate on a `Service` method for example, as opposed to validating the `RequestBody` in the `Controller`.
* Validation annotations on a `@RequestParam` parameter now leads to the addition of `parameterErrors` in the error response.

As an example, this contains the 3 possible types of validation errors that can happen:

[source,json]
----
{
  "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
  "message": "Validation failed for object='exampleRequestBody'. Error count: 4",
  "fieldErrors": [
    {
      "code": "INVALID_SIZE",
      "property": "name",
      "message": "size must be between 10 and 2147483647",
      "rejectedValue": ""
    },
    {
      "code": "REQUIRED_NOT_BLANK",
      "property": "favoriteMovie",
      "message": "must not be blank",
      "rejectedValue": null
    }
  ],
  "globalErrors": [
    {
      "code": "ValidCustomer",
      "message": "Invalid customer"
    },
    {
      "code": "ValidCustomer",
      "message": "UserAlreadyExists"
    }
  ],
  "parameterErrors": [
    {
      "code": "REQUIRED_NOT_NULL",
      "message": "must not be null",
      "parameter": "extraArg",
      "rejectedValue": null
    }
  ]
}

== New documentation website

There is a new documentation website at https://wimdeblauwe.github.io/error-handling-spring-boot-starter/

I am quite proud of the site, but it was really the https://github.com/spring-io/spring-asciidoctor-backends[spring-asciidoctor-backends] project that made it possible.

It even has a light and a dark mode:
