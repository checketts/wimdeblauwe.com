This blog post will show the best way to implement a HTML `<select/>` to allow the user to select between one of several options.

<!--more-->

To recap, the https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp[HTML select tag] looks like this when using plain HTML:

[source,html]
----
<label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>

<select name="cars" id="cars">
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>
----

The browser renders this similar to this:

It is important that each `<option>` has a `value` with should be some kind of unique id for that option. It also has the text this is visible to the user.

As a consequence, we should ensure that the collection of possible objects in our Spring MVC model has at least those 2 fields available.

Let's take the example of a sports team that has a coach. It must be possible to select from the list of coaches via a select.

Assume this class:

[source,java]
----
public class UserDto {
    private final long id;
    private final String name;
}
----

In our controller, we will put instances of this class in the Model:

[source,java]
----
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/team")
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/{teamId}")
    public String (@PathVariable("teamId") long teamId, Model model) {
        Team team = teamService.getTeam(teamId).orElseThrow( () -> ...);
        model.addAttribute("team", EditTeamFormData.fromTeam(team));
        model.addAttribute("users", userService.getAllUsersNameAndId()); //<.>

        return "teams/edit";
    }
}
----
<.> Put the collection of `UserDto` objects under the `users` key.

The relevant part of the Thymeleaf template should look like this:

[source,html]
----
<div>
    <label for="coachId" th:text="#{team.coach}"></label>
    <div>
        <select th:field="*{coachId}">
            <option th:each="user : ${users}"
                    th:text="${user.name}"
                    th:value="${user.id}">
        </select>
    </div>
</div>
----

Important points:

* The `<select>` has a `th:field` attribute that references to the `coachId` property of the `team` form data object.
* We create as many `<option>` subtags as there are `users` via the `th:each` iteration.
* Use `th:text` for the visible text that the user will see.
* Use `th:value` for the value associated with the option (The primary key of the user in our case)

We do not use the `Team` entity directly in our Model, but an `EditTeamFormData` class which is very similar to the `Team` entity.
This is really important, if you try to make it work directly with the entity, you are going to have a hard time.
The difference between those classes is how the link is made with the coach.
In the `Team` entity this is done like this (assuming a single user can only be coach of 1 team):

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Team {
    ...

    @OneToOne
    private User coach;
}
----

In the `EditTeamFormData`, we just use the `id` of the user:

[source,java]
----
public class EditTeamFormData {
    ...
    private long coachId;

    public EditTeamFormData fromTeam(Team team) {
        EditTeamFormData result = new EditTeamFormData();
        ...
        result.setCoachId(team.getCoach().getId());
        ...
        return result;
    }
}
----

Thymeleaf will set the `<option>` to `selected` automatically for the tag where the `value` matches with the current `coachId`.

If we look at the page source in the browser, it will look something like this:

[source,html]
----
<select class=""
        id="coachId"
        name="coachId">
    ...
    <option value="381e104f-4fe9-45d1-aa00-1e7679fb1bc4">Donita Koepp
    </option>
    <option value="13a38612-1b2b-441b-9dc3-42b039cd9fa3">Drew Herzog
    </option>
    <option value="b584818a-2c57-457c-a502-49ce87ac34a5" selected="selected">Earle Wehner
    </option>
    <option value="ada75a4d-4d25-4338-a145-aee90c1cb4c8">Ed Corkery
    </option>
    <option value="99bbf611-1ee6-40b3-8874-965cbcba93b1">Emmett Bailey
    </option>
    ...
</select>
----

In the handling of the POST of the form, we can take the selected `coachId` from the `EditTeamFormData` instance and look up the actual user again from that id.

[source,java]
----
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/team")
public class MyController {

    ...

    @PostMapping("/{teamId}")
    public String (@PathVariable("teamId") long teamId, @ModelAttribute("team") EditTeamFormData formData) {

        User coach = userService.getUser(formData.getCoachId).orElseThrow(()->...);
        // put the coach on the Team entity either here or in a Service
    }
}
----

Using a HTML `<select>` with Thymeleaf is not that difficult if you take the above things into consideration, but it might be non-obvious to get started.
